# Goal
The goal is to create data-analysis-friendly datasets out of the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) data that [Transparency International](https://www.transparency.org/) creates. For eg. the current version creates csv files out of the xls files (for 10 years of CPI data) that can be uploaded to Kaggle or put for other uses.

# How to run
After you clone the repo :
1. Unzip all the zip files into a folder with the same name (for eg. Data.zip -> folder Data)
2. Install [Anaconda3](https://www.anaconda.com/) (2019.10 version or greater) (or create a Python virtual environment with Numpy, Pandas>=0.25 & Jupyter)
3. Run the ProcessData.ipynb Jupyter notebook to create all the datasets for 2010-2019 CPI datasets

Now, you can use the datasets with Python or upload it to other places.

# Thanks
Thanks to [Transparency International](https://www.transparency.org/) for compiling the raw dataset without which this work would not have been possible. I couldn't find any licensing information for this dataset on the website. If I missed something or if [Transparency International](https://www.transparency.org/) wants to add it post-fact, please let me know & I can add the same to this repo.
